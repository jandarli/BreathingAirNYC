## Abstract  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, the visualization problem will address the relationship between air quality, air quality complaints and tree coverage in the urban setting of  New York City. The problem involves properly and effectively creating visualizations that will show the existence of any linkages between the datasets related to the aformentioned topics. Also, it is necessary to take into consideration other factors affecting air quality and thus any attempt to create a visualization showcasing its relationship to other factors that falls outside of the scope of this project.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many visualizations problems similar to the one descibed, choose to showcase data by employing map visualization techniques such as cartograms. However, many times these visualizations fall short of their goal and into the same catogories of problems. For example, the problem of distortion of boundaries adding layers to maps may occur when employing the cartogram techniques, which is often an important feature of a map. This not only takes away from the ability of the visualization to to accurately present the data in an easily comprehensible manner, but also from the ability to identify and solve the underlying problems represented by the data.
