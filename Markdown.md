## Abstract  
For this project, the visualization problem will address the relationship between air quality, air quality complaints and tree coverage 
in the urban setting of  New York City. The problem involves properly and effectively creating visualizations that will show the 
existence of any linkages between the datasets related to the aformentioned topics. The problem also involves taking into consideration
other factors that fall outside of the scope of this project 

## Data Processing
Since the project will be using three datasets there will be substantial time use on cleaning up the raw data before use. 
From the 2015 street tree dataset (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh/data) we will derive the number of trees living on the same street and the size of the tree to calculate the area coverage of the trees by size instead of number. From 311 air quality (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Indoor-Air-Quality/udax-ixue) we will get the number of complaints based on each street. In https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Air-Quality/b5f6-22ra we will get the the number of people affected by asthma that lives around the same location. Tools such as DataWrangler from http://vis.stanford.edu/wrangler/app/ will help us split, cut, and extract the data we need into a more usable format.

## Visualization
We want to show our data in a clear and straight forward way that covers a lot of area that in a glance we can see if the data set correlates to eachother or not. This is why we choose to make an interactive map for our visualization. As shown below:

We will make 3-4 layers to our map that shows the data about the tree population, tree size, air complaints, and asthma attacks in the different locations. By overlapping some of these layers we might be able to see a trend or maybe not about these data sets easily.
